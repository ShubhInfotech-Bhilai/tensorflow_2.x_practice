# tensorflow_2.x_practice

#### This repository contains deep learning practice codes implemented using tensorflow 2.x + keras.

### Contents:

- 01 - Linear Regression.
- 02 - Logistic Regression with First Order Equation.
- 03 - Logistic Regression with Second Order Equations.
- 04 - ANN Toy Dataset Example.
- 05 - ANN Cat Recognition.
- 06 - CNN LeNet Handwritten Digits Recognition.
- 07 - CNN Hand Sign Recognition.
- 08 - CNN AlexNet Architecture.

### Note:

    Due to resources' limitations, all CNN models are not possible to train here; but we can use transfer learning to run them. They also work just fine.

#### Some models are not trained in keras framework; so to make them working, here are some links to the weights.
